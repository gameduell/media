This project compiles webp to emscripten so it can be used in the web.

To compile run:
haxelib run hxcpp Build.xml -Demscripten

It will output a webpdecoder.js file.

There is a test file that you can use to test the decoding.
Just run "node test.js". You might need to install pngjs with "npm install pngjs"

You also have to change the emscripten toolchain in HXCPP a bit. The changes are:

- Change extension for intermediate object files to .bc
    - search for the compiler section and set <ext value=".bc" />
- Change extension of output to .js
    - search for the linker section and set <ext value=".js" />
